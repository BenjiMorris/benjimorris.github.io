Hi, I am a first year PhD student in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) at the University of Leeds, supervised by [Professor Paul Martin](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~ppmartin/) and [Professor Frank Nijhoff](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~frank/). 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the dynamic exchange between Mathematics and Physics, with a specific interest in the Algebraic, Analytic, and Topological machinery which underpins the phenomenon of integrability. I completed a BSc (with Honours) at the Australian National University in December 2021. My honours thesis ["Towards a Factorised Solution of the Yang-Baxter Equation with Uq(sl4) Symmetry"](documents/thesis.pdf) was supervised by [Professor Vladimir Mangazeev](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=327).
