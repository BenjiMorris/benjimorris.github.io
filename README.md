Hi, I am a third year EPSRC funded PhD candidate in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) at the University of Leeds, supervised by [Professor Paul Martin](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~ppmartin/) and [Professor Frank Nijhoff](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~frank/). 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in algebraic, representation theoretic, and combinatorial aspects of mathematical physics. Currently, my research concerns the representation theory of diagram algebras/categories, and their applications in low-dimensional topology. In the future I hope to investigate applications thereof in statistical mechanics and topological quantum systems. Previously, I have studied integrability (mostly solvability in lattice models) through the lense of the Yang-Baxter equation and related algebraic structures such as quantum groups, and developed a fondness for special functions (especially basic hypergeometric series)

I completed a BSc (with first class honours) at the Australian National University in December 2021. My honours thesis was supervised by [Professor Vladimir Mangazeev](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=327).
