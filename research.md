# Research and Selected Writings

- ### A Terminating q-Lauricella Transformation Formula
Available soon.
- ### November 2021: Towards a Factorised Solution of the Yang-Baxter Equation with Uq(sl_4) Symmetry
My Honours thesis, supervised by Professor Vladimir Mangazeev at the Australian National University. Available [here](/documents/thesis.pdf).
- ### June 2021: Thin Position for 3-manifolds
A Term Paper for a 3-manifold topology course taught by Dr Joan Licata. We present Scharlemann and Thompson's notion of thin position for 3-manifolds, as well as a more general Morse theoretic perspective. Available [here](/documents/thin_position.pdf).
- ### January 2021: Introduction to Quantum Groups
A summer reading project supervised by Professor Mangazeev in preparation for my honours project. The main report is available [here](/documents/intro_to_quantum_groups.pdf), and there are two supplementary documents ([here](/documents/qgpsAP1.pdf) and [here](/documents/qgpsAP2.pdf)) including a detailed worked example. 
- ### March 2020: Q-operators in Integrable Systems
A report from my 2019-20 summer research scholar project supervised by Professor Mangazeev. We study Baxter's "Q-operator" method for reproducing Bethe-Ansatz equations in integrable lattice models in statistical mechanics. Available [here](/documents/Q_ops_in_IS.pdf).
